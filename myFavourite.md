## Ingredients

* 1 cup fish stock
* 1 cup milk
* 12 ounces fish (assorted pieces)
* 1 bay leaf
* 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter
* 1 medium leek (white part only, washed thoroughly and finely sliced)
* 2 ounces (a little less than 1/2 cup) all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon fresh parsley (finely chopped)
* Salt (to taste)
* Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
* 5 1/2 cups mashed potatoes (warm and creamy)

_Optional: a handful of grated cheddar cheese_


##  Steps to Make It
1. Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 355 F / 180 C.
2. Pour the fish stock and milk into a large saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer.
3. Add the fish pieces and bay leaf and poach for 5 minutes.
4. Remove the fish pieces with a slotted spoon and set aside. Reserve the liquid in the pot.

## Tips
> Choose non-oily, fleshy fish such as salmon, cod, smoked haddock, and coley (aka pollock), which is similar to cod.  
>Either buy one type of fish (skin and bones removed) cut into bite-sized chunks, or mix different fish and/or prawns together.   
If using frozen fish, defrost it first to avoid water in the bottom of the casserole dish. Using fish that isn't properly defrosted can lead to a watery fish pie.
